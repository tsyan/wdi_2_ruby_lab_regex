@source_text = 'My home IP address is: 127.0.0.1. 
But that isn\'t my public IP address, that is 203.15.20.74.
Some IP addresses like 893.239.2939.2 would be invalid.
IP addresses from MIT start with an 18 like 18.221.23.4. Another one would be
18.238.10.38.

My phone number is 617-555-1212, which you could also write as 1-617-555-1212. 
The phone number of my best friend when I was a kid was 294-8438 but I
don\'t remember the area code. I sometimes buy music gear from 800-222-4700.
I\'ve tried to call the number 100-100-1111 but I think its invalid since the
phone system doesn\'t work when I call it. 

My email address is tibbon@gmail.com but email addresses are hard to validate
with regex. bob@example.com is an example address. 

My zip code is 02144 which is Somerville. I just was in 02134, which is Allston last night. 
In the US 039482 would be an invalid zip code. 

I love the color #ccddee but I really don\'t like the color #b1dafb. 
I once painted a room #741d0d. I tried to paint a room #y729iu but that isn\'t a color.
